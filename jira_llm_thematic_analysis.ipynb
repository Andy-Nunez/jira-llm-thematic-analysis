      "  - [2025-10-20 15:17] nicholas have already answered questions 1 to 6, while lauren addressed questions 7 and 8. it would be great if you could add more information so we can include it in our design. key questions answers 1. what is the workflow for lab reddraw? who is responsible for performing it? the original test that was ordered in epic by the provider was canceled in lis because it cannot be performed. the cancellation reason is documented on the lis order . replacement order s are created on a new lis order the 8-character number that starts with a letter, as you saw during the meeting . these replacement orders will generate an sn message being sent to epic. when this occurs, there is no existing order in epic for this new order to attach to. 2. in our call yesterday, it was mentioned that the laboratory results sometimes come without an order number from careconnect. does this mean the specimen or sample collection was done without an order? why does this happen? the original test is canceled in lis with documented reason , and replacement orders generate new lis order numbers without existing matching orders in epic. 3. if this action is permitted, how does the laboratory obtain patient information and print labels without a link to patient data in careconnect for the patient encounter or csn? all of the patient information exists in these newly created orders in lis which are attached to the same csn, which lis refers to as a billing . 4. how does the laboratory handle specimens outside the ed setting? all inpatient redraws are handled the same way. 5. what are the workflows to ensure patient information is available without an order from careconnect? how does the lab verify that these results correspond to the correct patient? patient and order info are stored in lis orders linked by csn. 6. how do they determine which order csn to assign to the result? patient and order info are stored in lis orders linked by csn. 7. within the ed narrator or ed track board, what options do we have to populate this information correctly? the nursing narrator filters orders based on ord-90 we have the option to set which statuses are included, but it does not allow for no value, so orders without ord-90 are never displayed to the nurses, which is impacting the redraw requests. ord-115 does not impact the narrator as far as we know and was not part of the request 8. from our call, i understand that if a laboratory result corresponds to a procedure listed in the redraw procedure list you will provide, we need to populate obr-25 with i in-process . this, in turn, populates ord-90 or ord-115. could you please clarify how this status is displayed to care providers in the ed? specifically, is it visible via the ed narrator or the ed track board? we don t want to handle redraw requests separately or in a special manner we just want them to show up where any other new collection order would be displayed. the reason for the focus on redraws is that these are currently broken.\n",

      "  - [2025-10-24 08:29] i wanted to provide a quick update on the sherlock ticket i opened for the lab redraw needed flag project on the ed track board. my ts connected with robert erhardt otx ts regarding the order status question i raised. here s the reply hey ryan, i spent some time talking with robert about this one - it sounds like order status is probably not the way to go. one option that would be consistent with how the ed does collection today would be to send the new orders through order transmittal and generate a collection task for the nurses that way. the incoming interface doesn't do this by default, but we can turn it on via trigger otx and trigger otx options 3-new orders. the issue with turning on otx is that it's going to start running it for all orders created by the interface. i'm seeing a lot of traffic for poct glucose and micro tests that are following the same sn na pattern, and we might not want to send those orders through otx. can we clarify with soft all of the scenarios where they are placing new orders in soft? we're probably going to need to do some testing and tweaking to get this right. the interface has very little flexibility - it either calls otx or it doesn't. anything beyond that, and we need the otx rules to handle things.\n",
      "  - [2025-10-24 12:17] - who, specifically, needs to do the follow-up you outlined above? is it an lis task? fyi, fyi\n",
      "  - [2025-10-24 12:32] molly this morning, i sent an email including my ts and chad c. regarding potential workarounds in soft and epic. my original email asked soft is there a way to add a flag if the result message is a redraw? this would allow us to specifically identify redraw messages. epic one potential, though not ideal, solution is turning on trigger otx with trigger otx options 3-new orders . the challenge here is that it would run for all orders created by the interface. could otx generate a flag on messages triggered by a soft redraw so we could filter these in rhapsody and prevent them from being sent downstream? chad responded with the following without any lab process workflow changes the rhap logic would have to be multi layered in order to tease out just the soft initiated orders that are specific to lab redraws 99 of the orders that originate in soft unsolicited orders sent from soft cc are not lab redraw orders what the rhap logic might look like patient class is ed patient has a canceled lab test on that visit lab placed a prob code order on visit lab placed a new order for the test that was cancelled if all true send a redraw flag to the track board there is nothing unique about a lab redraw order in the hl7 message. next steps we are going to check with the labs to see if they would be willing to alter their workflow the idea all labs add a redraw comment or order to any test that needs to be re-order an ed and rhap would fire on that?? the unfortunate part is that this would be a lab workflow driven solution human error could contribute to tests not flagging i have updated the sherlock ticket i opened this morning. our ts has not yet responded. given these challenges, the oct 27 design deadline is not achievable for this project. we are still exploring alternative workarounds to meet our objectives.\n",
