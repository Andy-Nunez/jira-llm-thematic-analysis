  - [2025-10-20 11:13] - please see update below. our meeting is scheduled for 10 27 with janene which will make it difficult to complete design during this release.
  - [2025-10-21 11:37] pushing this to the mid-november release, per garret's update that they are meeting with operations on 10 27.

Issue SWIFT-6337:
  - [2025-10-07 13:50] is this design in progress? based on the status it is being worked on, but i don't see any updates. it is not currently assigned to the october release, so wanted to see where we are, and if it should be part of the october release or the november release?
  - [2025-10-07 16:05] yes i've been working on this design for the last few weeks. i was told that this was to be made a top priority and to begin working on this immediately. we can probably add this to the current release since i'm hoping to have the design finalized by the 10 27 deadline.
  - [2025-10-20 11:23] is this design complete at this point?
  - [2025-10-24 10:33] i was hoping to get this done by end of this week, but i don't think that's going to happen. the users requesting this added in changes based on an updated policy for 2026 which added in a large amount of design items we're still trying to determine how to incorporate. can we move this design to the next release?
  - [2025-10-24 11:29] , thanks for letting me know. if there is no way to complete this by 10 27, i will push it. however, moving forward, let's try to front-load the designs in the release month so we don't run into this again. it sounds like the design meetings have been ongoing since september, and your last update was on 10 7. if there was a risk here. i'd like to have known about it sooner than 3 days before the deadline. additionally, this was not brought up as a risk during our stand-ups, and it sounds like it should have been. these things are 'lessons learned' moving forward, so we don't have items fall out of the release. fyi
  - [2025-10-27 09:21] didn't hear back from you, and there wasn't an update on the stand-up this morning, so pushing this to the november release. fyi

  - [2025-10-22 14:02] reopened design to review brd spec after speaking with jeff. this may not be doable as the documentation lays out due to it calling out apps which may not be documented in transactions feeding to premier. i also need to review the association of baby to mother, and likely i will have to run some findings through a clinical report writer. this is likely considered design - jeff maybe called out the need for something between design and build - planning which could cause something to send back to design. if research shows this won't work, we will send back to design committee or meet with evan. i would rather just meet with evan than pass a hot potato back and forth when we get to that time, but hours i need to log should be considered design scope.
  - [2025-10-24 10:03] , , , this design was complete and signed off on by operations on 10 15. now, on 10 24, this design is being pulled from the october release. something was missed. all necessary reviews should have happened before the design was marked as done. this was an osc escalated swift, which indicated needed to be a high priority, so pushing design to november is really concerning, as that likely means dev won't be done until the end of december. unless you think that the remaining design and dev can be done in november. please let me know as soon as possible if there is any way to keep this design in the october release and stay on track.

  - [2025-11-10 11:01] , , a brd is a business requirements document. it is how the d a team documents requirements and use cases for the request. typically, we've been leaving swifts in triage until that brd is completed, but this one did not go through the triage process as it was already in jira. jamie, perhaps you can join evan in the brd development process with operations and get all the questions answered in one session?

  - [2025-11-10 10:18] as noted in the previous meeting summary, enabling access to the new note type will require activating additional functionality. while this enhancement allows users to select different note types from a centralized location, it comes with a significant drawback users will lose access to all of their existing note writer templates. this issue must be resolved before we can finalize and approve the design. two emails sent to design team for discussion.

Issue SWIFT-6966:

  - [2025-10-20 11:03] design is not complete. a slg needs to be placed for interface questions, ryan was going to do that. nick is also ooo for the next 2 weeks.
  - [2025-10-20 11:29] last week, we had our first call. from my side, i believe i understood what s needed to finalize the design from the interface perspective. after the call, a few questions came up on my end, which i sent to the group, and i m currently waiting for a reply. below is the list of questions i shared some of which have already been answered by nicholas. questions what is the workflow for lab reddraw? who is responsible for performing it? from our call, it was mentioned that the laboratory results sometimes come without an order number from careconnect. does this mean the specimen or sample collection was done without an order? why does this happen? if this action is permitted, how does the laboratory obtain patient information and print labels without a link to patient data in careconnect for the patient encounter or csn? how does the laboratory handle specimens outside the ed setting? what are the workflows to ensure patient information is available without an order from careconnect? how does the lab verify that these results correspond to the correct patient? how do they determine which order csn to assign to the result? within the ed narrator or ed track board, what options do we have to populate this information correctly? from our discussion, i understand that when a laboratory result corresponds to a procedure included in the redraw procedure list provided by lis, we should populate obr-25 with i in-process . this status then flows through to ord-90 or ord-115 ord-90 or ord-115. . could you please clarify how this status is presented to care providers in the emergency department? specifically, is it visible in the ed narrator or ed track board.
  - [2025-10-20 11:48] and , it s true that i will create an slg, but i can t move forward until the questions i asked the group are answered.
  - [2025-10-20 13:24] slg 10531142 5013591 create a 'lab redraw needed' flag for the ed track board was created.
  - [2025-10-20 13:46] please assign another resource to assist with this design so we can meet the 10 27 deadline. it may help for you to tag specifically who you need to answer each of your questions. , , fyi
  - [2025-10-20 14:13] all the questions were answered, and i already opened a slg. i'm waiting for the reply from my ts.
  - [2025-10-20 14:35] ryan - do we need to get answer to all your questions before we can complete the design? we will have to reach out to hospitals. the nurses manage all specimen redraws at most hospitals.
  - [2025-10-20 15:17] nicholas have already answered questions 1 to 6, while lauren addressed questions 7 and 8. it would be great if you could add more information so we can include it in our design. key questions answers 1. what is the workflow for lab reddraw? who is responsible for performing it? the original test that was ordered in epic by the provider was canceled in lis because it cannot be performed. the cancellation reason is documented on the lis order . replacement order s are created on a new lis order the 8-character number that starts with a letter, as you saw during the meeting . these replacement orders will generate an sn message being sent to epic. when this occurs, there is no existing order in epic for this new order to attach to. 2. in our call yesterday, it was mentioned that the laboratory results sometimes come without an order number from careconnect. does this mean the specimen or sample collection was done without an order? why does this happen? the original test is canceled in lis with documented reason , and replacement orders generate new lis order numbers without existing matching orders in epic. 3. if this action is permitted, how does the laboratory obtain patient information and print labels without a link to patient data in careconnect for the patient encounter or csn? all of the patient information exists in these newly created orders in lis which are attached to the same csn, which lis refers to as a billing . 4. how does the laboratory handle specimens outside the ed setting? all inpatient redraws are handled the same way. 5. what are the workflows to ensure patient information is available without an order from careconnect? how does the lab verify that these results correspond to the correct patient? patient and order info are stored in lis orders linked by csn. 6. how do they determine which order csn to assign to the result? patient and order info are stored in lis orders linked by csn. 7. within the ed narrator or ed track board, what options do we have to populate this information correctly? the nursing narrator filters orders based on ord-90 we have the option to set which statuses are included, but it does not allow for no value, so orders without ord-90 are never displayed to the nurses, which is impacting the redraw requests. ord-115 does not impact the narrator as far as we know and was not part of the request 8. from our call, i understand that if a laboratory result corresponds to a procedure listed in the redraw procedure list you will provide, we need to populate obr-25 with i in-process . this, in turn, populates ord-90 or ord-115. could you please clarify how this status is displayed to care providers in the ed? specifically, is it visible via the ed narrator or the ed track board? we don t want to handle redraw requests separately or in a special manner we just want them to show up where any other new collection order would be displayed. the reason for the focus on redraws is that these are currently broken.
  - [2025-10-21 13:31] what additional information are you looking for? are there any specific questions that you have?
  - [2025-10-21 13:51] i don't have any questions aside the 8 question which i posted. i don't see any update from my ts on the slg created. i will follow-up on him.
  - [2025-10-22 08:59] there is a risk that this design won't be complete by 10 27. there is an slg for this, and we are waiting on a response. a confirmation is needed from the interface ts. to reach out again today and include molly and chris.
  - [2025-10-24 08:29] i wanted to provide a quick update on the sherlock ticket i opened for the lab redraw needed flag project on the ed track board. my ts connected with robert erhardt otx ts regarding the order status question i raised. here s the reply hey ryan, i spent some time talking with robert about this one - it sounds like order status is probably not the way to go. one option that would be consistent with how the ed does collection today would be to send the new orders through order transmittal and generate a collection task for the nurses that way. the incoming interface doesn't do this by default, but we can turn it on via trigger otx and trigger otx options 3-new orders. the issue with turning on otx is that it's going to start running it for all orders created by the interface. i'm seeing a lot of traffic for poct glucose and micro tests that are following the same sn na pattern, and we might not want to send those orders through otx. can we clarify with soft all of the scenarios where they are placing new orders in soft? we're probably going to need to do some testing and tweaking to get this right. the interface has very little flexibility - it either calls otx or it doesn't. anything beyond that, and we need the otx rules to handle things.
  - [2025-10-24 12:17] - who, specifically, needs to do the follow-up you outlined above? is it an lis task? fyi, fyi
  - [2025-10-24 12:32] molly this morning, i sent an email including my ts and chad c. regarding potential workarounds in soft and epic. my original email asked soft is there a way to add a flag if the result message is a redraw? this would allow us to specifically identify redraw messages. epic one potential, though not ideal, solution is turning on trigger otx with trigger otx options 3-new orders . the challenge here is that it would run for all orders created by the interface. could otx generate a flag on messages triggered by a soft redraw so we could filter these in rhapsody and prevent them from being sent downstream? chad responded with the following without any lab process workflow changes the rhap logic would have to be multi layered in order to tease out just the soft initiated orders that are specific to lab redraws 99 of the orders that originate in soft unsolicited orders sent from soft cc are not lab redraw orders what the rhap logic might look like patient class is ed patient has a canceled lab test on that visit lab placed a prob code order on visit lab placed a new order for the test that was cancelled if all true send a redraw flag to the track board there is nothing unique about a lab redraw order in the hl7 message. next steps we are going to check with the labs to see if they would be willing to alter their workflow the idea all labs add a redraw comment or order to any test that needs to be re-order an ed and rhap would fire on that?? the unfortunate part is that this would be a lab workflow driven solution human error could contribute to tests not flagging i have updated the sherlock ticket i opened this morning. our ts has not yet responded. given these challenges, the oct 27 design deadline is not achievable for this project. we are still exploring alternative workarounds to meet our objectives.
  - [2025-10-27 08:57] thank you for the thorough updates! moving this design to the november release as we continue to work with epic and soft.
  - [2025-10-29 08:38] new update from robert erhardt on the slg 10531142. discussed during asap call on 10 28. robert - what determines if the order shows in 'orders to be acknowledged'? show in cerner bridge - reprint the labels from there what eap is being used for the lab redraw? some cases the original eap comes back some times specific component assuming it can be setup to show in 'orders to be acknowledged' otx may be overkill in this case we are only generating a completion task, so if we can get it to show in orders to be acknowledged that would be best from there things could be done outside of epic
  - [2025-11-05 08:46] will schedule meeting with and to make a decision on the way forward or if we need to discuss the request with dr. higgins.
  - [2025-11-05 10:33] there is going to be a meeting scheduled with nick donato, john landry and ryan pacleb. what we need to proof of concept today when the lab needs a redraw they place the new order - that new order generates a hl7 'sn' message sent from soft. that sn message need to be a trigger to add a flag to the ed tracker when you see this message type and the pt type is ed add a flag . if a new sample is not needed for the for the new orders the lab will collect receive that new order and this will generate an sc message and that message will remove the test from the tracker sometimes the labs add new orders and just run those off of samples they already have in the lab .
  - [2025-11-06 15:32] - see chad's comment and please incorporate this approach into the email you are setting up with the epic ts staff. thanks!
  - [2025-11-06 15:41] thank you chris and i will.
  - [2025-11-10 08:39] is setting up a call with the appropriate ts team members, aiming for this week.

Issue SWIFT-6990:
  - [2025-11-06 11:54] and - checking in on this design, as it is still in to do. is there a plan to get it started?
  - [2025-11-06 12:01] the build has been started, but there has been some trouble determining what some of the defaults should be. there are some concerns of patient safety in areas outside of ed depending on the rates that are defaulted. it is still being debated as to the best way to move forward. the conversation is happening between clinicians at various sites that use this mannitol record.
  - [2025-11-06 14:09] thank you! so, it sounds like design is underway. i've updated the statuses to reflect that this is in progress. please make sure that the design is being documented in the design document https confluence-prd.rochesterregional.org spaces sdtes pages 235799760 swift-4693 - 5014203 mannitol bolus also, please note that this is in the design phase, not in the dev phase yet. if design is completed, and we can also do development in this release, we can discuss that and add it if appropriate. fyi

Issue SWIFT-7042:
  - [2025-10-17 14:14] checking in on this one, as it is assigned to the 10 27 release for dev but there are no updates on progress, and it is assigned to you rather than an analyst. thanks!
  - [2025-10-17 15:04] there was meeting that took place on 10 16 2025. the orderset was presented and further changes are being requested. there will be a meeting scheduled to identify the further changes. that is not scheduled at this time.
  - [2025-10-23 16:57] this is supposed to go to prd on monday. was there another meeting held? does this need to go back to design? please provide an update.
  - [2025-10-27 08:38] and - for future releases, please note that we shouldn't have items falling out of the release like this. the initial meeting, where issues were identified, was held on 10 16, which left plenty of time for a follow-up meeting. additionally, this is another one that perhaps should have had a design phase. i will move this to the november release.
  - [2025-10-27 13:12] and - the build was completed based on the 2024 guidelines that were attached to the request. i met with several members from the asp group last thursday including dr. laguio and it was determined that guidelines had changed somewhat again and there is a stronger desire to push paxlovid in more patients as opposed to remdesivir to save money and time, where appropriate. due to that, the build needs to be updated and is being reviewed by asp and pharmacy to ensure there are no other updates that need to be taken into account. once those updates are built, the order set will need to go in front of the asp group for final approval, which is held towards the end of each month.

  - [2025-10-03 11:56] attached brd to parent link and reviewed with mary king. after brd sign off, we can proceed with a design session. adding josh to this effort.
  - [2025-10-06 10:00] requested update via teams hi https jira.rochesterregional.org browse design for 5011223 urgent care transfers the design epic is currently in a status of to do , but 3 of the 4 stories are in a status of in progress . is there anything blocking the progression of this design or does the status of the epic just need updating.
  - [2025-10-06 11:18] hey - it looks like bi will be kicking off a design session with us in the near future. just something to keep on your radar.
  - [2025-10-07 15:58] brd reviewed with submitter, added additional details that did not pull over from ivanti below regarding scope of this request being for all ambulatory, and not limited to urgent as original request stated, smart phrase below had been drafted in attempt to have easily accessible sdes for this reporting by ciara smith c350735 sent a year ago met with the requestors and tiffany smith around this request. currently, all ambulatory practices and urgent cares are tracking transfers from their outpatient sites to the ed with safe connect. safe connect is not a reliable way to record this information and they have been asked to find an alternative. currently there are three identified ways a patient gets sent to the ed from the ambulatory space 1. from urgent care, they are told to go to the ed private vs ambulance 2. from outpatient setting they are told to go to the ed private vs ambulance 3. triage nurse on the phone tells patient to go to the ed to measure these events for regulatory requirements- the group discussed with krista and i the ability to have a smart phrase with data elements to capture these transfers in care connect. the group previously have drafted what they would like this smart phrase to look like. .emergencytx this individual suffers from an emergency medical condition that requires care beyond our services provided. after clinical assessment by provider clinician name it has been determined this patient requires emergency medical care or transfer to higher level of care. explanation of benefits of transfer and risks of refusing transfer yes no agreeable to transfer yes no transferred to name mode of transportation ems private vehicle medical cab uber bus walk freetext report to family agency name ems name ems arrival time 0000 transfer center contacted name refuses transfer yes no accompanied by name freetext mode of transportation private vehicle walk medical cab uber bus freetext notifications provider security sw 911 reported reason freetext why transfer is refused interpretation provided yes no language name or id with this smartphrase, can we include the ability to include a discrete data element so we can report on and measure how often these events occur?
  - [2025-10-07 16:09] updated brd uploaded, additions highlighted in yellow
  - [2025-10-14 14:34] submitter just shared updated doc with smart phrase .emergencytx details updated- uploaded doc to design epic
  - [2025-10-15 12:45] ian-shika will review updated information. we will schedule a design meeting if outstanding questions remain. if none remain, we can complete design phase.
  - [2025-10-15 16:12] thanks for the document, can you have the submitter also confirm which are to be smart data elements.
  - [2025-10-17 11:25] status update met today with mary, ian-shika, and joshua to discuss reporting needs and potential workflow solutions. the next step is to engage operational partners to clarify specific reporting requirements and assess whether existing workflows can be leveraged instead of initiating a new build. mary will coordinate and schedule a meeting between it and operations to move this forward.
  - [2025-10-20 10:50] , , , , when do you anticipate completing this design?
  - [2025-10-20 10:58] we're meeting with the operational requestor tomorrow morning to go over this. the solution design that they had suggested of using a smart phrase in a note is not an ideal situation and potentially not even feasible. it will make reporting on those values quite tricky. i'm hoping to be able to see if they can utilize the new transfer center workflow for these visits.
  - [2025-10-21 11:36] after meeting today, the solution that was designed will not work, particularly for the da team and reporting. pushing this to the mid-november release.
  - [2025-10-21 17:12] h3. meeting notes date october 21, 2025 attendees christian, tiffany, josh, ian-shika discussion summary reviewed the initial design plan for a smartphrase incorporating embedded sde records. identified a major concern the current design would require reporting tools to search across all patient records in the system, which could significantly impact system memory and performance. a new order-based approach was proposed as a potential alternative. amb will explore possible solutions in collaboration with bi partners to ensure reporting efficiency and system stability. next steps amb to investigate technical feasibility of the proposed order-based solution. bi team to assess reporting implications and provide input on system impact.
  - [2025-10-29 17:40] design session scheduled for 11 4.
  - [2025-11-04 17:11] status update met today with josh and ian-shika to discuss ongoing concerns raised by our bi partners regarding the current design. ambulatory team met with their ts and were unable to come up with a different design idea. we ll bring this up during tomorrow s stand-up to gather further guidance and determine next steps.
  - [2025-11-05 08:42] ambulatory ts is involved, will involve the bi ts, hopefully tomorrow afternoon to resolve between epic tss
  - [2025-11-05 10:10] status update this was discussed during the stand-up meeting. the next step is to coordinate scheduling between the bi ts and amb ts teams.
  - [2025-11-05 14:35] epic ts meeting set for 4pm on 11 6 to continue design discussion and work through roadblocks, if possible.
  - [2025-11-07 10:22] status update met with the bi and amb teams, including each team's epic ts. we discussed potential solutions, and peter wang amb ts suggested that the sdes could be built with an encounter context, which would significantly improve reporting capabilities. the bi team requested that peter further investigate any additional epic recommendations. once peter completes his follow-up, we plan to reconvene with our operational partners to finalize the design.

Issue SWIFT-7075:
  - [2025-10-06 09:53] reached out via teams for a status update , - regarding 5013958 build for canadian providers orders. the design epic, and associated stories, are all in to do status. also, i don't see a story for erik's team. what is the plan with this one? are you still going to use the 10 hours for design and then likely convert this to a rr? thanks!
  - [2025-10-06 10:01] reviewed this request with , imaging should just work if the provider is recorded and a fax number is provided to transmit the result.
  - [2025-10-06 10:33] need to confirm cost impact. thought is that no real impact due to staying within north america.
  - [2025-10-13 11:47] hi i am looking for representatives for this swift from security, cadence and interface.
  - [2025-10-14 10:24] interfaces is wondering... -will these providers' data come into care connect via our standard interface from msow? -if so, will their care connect provid be included? current interface design from msow to care connect we discard any transactions for which there is no npi or epic prov id in the message from msow.
  - [2025-10-14 10:30] manual entry of the provider as lrp? do these all start in msow? interface activity may be to understand the impact of implementing the extension in epic on how the npi field also represents the ohip value for canadian providers.
  - [2025-10-14 11:19] remember the solution we are trying to solve. patient walks in with a req for bloodwork or radiology test from their doctor in canada. this would be no different than a person from florida walking into our laboratory services, and getting blood work for a doctor in florida. the only difference is the provider is from canada who has a special identification number not an npi
  - [2025-10-14 11:45] yes, these providers are all manually entered into msow, by cc security if comes from any user other than the lab. the lab does the bulk of them. there is an issue about this however as the demographic information is not always current and there is no process in place to verify info. the lab does try to do some, but it's not perfect and could potentially be a hipaa violation. cc security nor the lab have the capacity to make these verifications, it would be a ft job.
  - [2025-10-15 08:47] - currently we believe that ivanti has a form to add a new provider. since canadian doctors have a different number other than npi. do you want a new form for canadian doctors, or modify current form?

  - [2025-10-27 08:55] , based on the conversation in the stand-up this morning, it sounds like this design will need to be pushed out to november. i'm making that update, but please correct me if i'm wrong! your story is still in progress. is your design work complete? fyi
  - [2025-10-27 09:13] - if this design is being pushed out, wouldn't these all need to stay open?

  - [2025-10-22 13:37] received design information from tracy ford. design epic will be marked as complete. development will be done in november.
  - [2025-10-30 09:36] operations agreed on an 11 10 move to prd date.
  - [2025-11-05 08:37] and will meet with the operational leader to have this functionality delivered to prd and then put in another swift for changes to augment.
  - [2025-11-10 11:35] tracy ford emailed on 11 7 asking that this not be moved to prd this month, as they have identified several workflows and processes that will need to be reviewed and updated to ensure alignment with the changes. i've suggested that this swift be cancelled, and that tracy reenters one when they've completed all necessary reviews. i'm waiting on a response from tracy on this recommendation.

  - [2025-10-22 08:49] additional discussion is needed prior to completing this design. moving this to the november release. the 3 related swifts may be turned in to a rr, as there is governance needed around these workflows. there is also epic standard functionality that should be considered. also asked that the vbc mapping teams be involved in these conversations as well.

  - [2025-10-29 10:31] moving this to the next release per a comment from the physician builder on the idea.
  - [2025-11-04 12:41] and please confirm if this is planned for 11 10? if so, the crq 7023288 needs to be updated to that src. fyi
  - [2025-11-04 13:40] i have emailed megan about this change. i believe she was working nights and was unable to address this at the time. will update the crq once she she has done the testing i believe this small change can be an mrc . thanks!
  - [2025-11-10 09:31] and - the crq 7023288 still indicates 10 27. what is the plan for this change?

  - [2025-10-06 17:15] 
  - [2025-10-08 10:33] buildtracker attached
  - [2025-10-13 10:14] per mostafa, this is not ready for prd after testing last week. moving this back to in progress. anticipated completion for the 10 27 release.
  - [2025-10-20 11:18] molly, i just talked to mostafa who is working on this build. there are still some changes needed to the build based on operational leader's feedback. this will need to be moved to the next month's release.
  - [2025-10-20 13:55] and - is there anything we can do to move this forward and meet the 10 27 deadline?
  - [2025-10-22 09:31] hello, i have made the recommended edits and will be reviewing with my superiors tomorrow. also checking in with quality to ensure that the documentation of reassessment of sepsis meets the standards set by cms. with all of those actions taken, the plan is to ensure that these smartitems are copacetic by thursday.
  - [2025-10-23 17:43] and checking in on this. and is there a crq?
  - [2025-10-24 10:49] crq was approved, but i put it on hold as i did not hear from mostafa that it is being second tested and confirmed by operational leaders this week. this will need to be moved to the next src.
  - [2025-10-24 11:16] and - we really need to avoid pushing items to the next release as much as possible. it is important that we complete those items that we've promised. what do we need to do to complete this for monday?
  - [2025-10-24 12:13] from i have been trying to log in to poc to test my smartphrase, and have been unable to do any second-testing or build review all week. i don't think it will be prudent to deploy on monday as i cannot build-test this week. moving this to the november release.
  - [2025-11-05 11:57] submitted to move this to prd with maintenance on 11 6

Issue SWIFT-7393:
  - [2025-10-22 17:10] the requester needs data up-to-date until october 31, so i plan to deliver the extract on november 1 or the first working day after that. i will not be able to mark this as done before then. given this is scheduled for oct 27 release although this is unrelated to care connect i am looking for advise on how to handle this, as this may impact our reporting around items completed within a release. let me know what you think.
  - [2025-10-22 18:32] hi , thanks for letting me know! i think it makes the most sense to move this to the november release since it cannot technically be completed until 11 1. that's no problem! i will make the update now.
  - [2025-10-27 10:53] , this is not yet updated. i'd be happy to help if you could guide me on where to update the date.
  - [2025-10-27 11:25] i had updated the fix version release , but forgot to update the end date on the epic and idea. that has been done now. is there something else you are seeing that is incorrect?
  - [2025-10-27 11:37] nope, looks good now! thanks.

  - [2025-10-23 16:49] , , , , , tracy mentioned today that this design is complete. please confirm, and if it is please mark your stories as done. once this is confirmed, we will mark the idea as ready for development. thanks!
  - [2025-10-24 16:10] email sent to , , , , on 10 24 at 8 45am good morning, everyone - yesterday at osc we did not get much time to discuss the c. auris dashboard swift, so wanted to have a conversation via email to confirm the urgency of this request and next steps. the team has met with operations, and internally, to come up with a design proposal. tracy can certainly speak more eloquently to this than i can, but essentially the team is proposing a two-wave approach wave 1 - 40 hours of work, so can remain in the swift process real-time admitted patients dashboard built from reporting workbench components facility-level summary of admitted c. auris patients. infection vs. colonization status. medically ready for discharge mrd counts and discharge barriers. drill-down detail for mrd patients with device-related barriers. wave 2 - 100 hours of work, so would need to be submitted as a resource request trending and community dashboard built from cogito radar metrics, clarity or caboodle tbd by developer. historical and current counts of flagged c. auris patients. surveillance status and follow-up needs post-discharge . community vs. hospital acquired. pending and completed lab results for flagged patients system-wide. add pending lab results for admitted patients to the real-time admitted patients dashboard from wave 1. additional details of the design proposal can be found here swift-7458 design https confluence-prd.rochesterregional.org spaces sdtes pages 243499050 swift-7458 - create a c. auris dashboard to monitor current patients across the system with a c. auris diagnosis at this time, the design is complete and just needs signing off from operations. if we can get that, we can add swift-7458, which represents wave 1 described above, to the november release likely with a few adjustments to what is already there . please review and let us know if this is an acceptable path forward, as this came from an incident command situation. in the meantime, we will work to get time set up with operations to discuss with them as well. tracy, evan, venu, please let me and the group know if i've missed or misrepresented anything! thanks! molly design meeting scheduled for 10 28 at 3 30 pm.
  - [2025-11-04 09:28] if design is done then mark complete... looks like this is a convert to rr
  - [2025-11-04 11:00] , . the end users approved the proposed design. wave 1- 40 hrs worth of work was determined to be able to be completed as a part of this swift, while the rest was to be tackled by an rr later. so this is not to be converted to rr, this is to get the wave-1 done and then submit a separate rr for the wave-2 work. do i capture that appropriately?
  - [2025-11-04 15:18] thanks! yes, this swift will track the wave 1 work, as discussed. i believe the design is complete at this time, so i'm going to mark this swift as done. i will then change the idea to ready for development. , as discussed at osc, we may need to shift something in the november release in order to add this development to it.
