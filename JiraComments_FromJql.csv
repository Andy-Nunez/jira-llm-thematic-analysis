Good morning, everyone -
 
Yesterday at OSC we did not get much time to discuss the C. auris dashboard SWIFT, so wanted to have a conversation via email to confirm the urgency of this request and next steps.
 
The team has met with Operations, and internally, to come up with a Design proposal. Tracy can certainly speak more eloquently to this than I can, but essentially the team is proposing a two-wave approach: 
 
Wave 1 - 40 hours of work, so can remain in the SWIFT process 
 * Real-Time Admitted Patients Dashboard 
 ** Built from Reporting Workbench components
 ** Facility-level summary of admitted C. auris patients.
 ** Infection vs. colonization status.
 ** Medically Ready for Discharge (MRD) counts and discharge barriers.
 ** Drill-down detail for MRD patients with device-related barriers.

Wave 2 - 100+ hours of work, so would need to be submitted as a Resource Request 
 * Trending and Community Dashboard 
 ** Built from Cogito Radar Metrics, Clarity or Caboodle TBD by developer.
 ** Historical and current counts of flagged C. auris patients.
 ** Surveillance status and follow-up needs (post-discharge).
 ** Community vs. Hospital Acquired.
 ** Pending and completed lab results for flagged patients system-wide.

 * Add pending lab results for admitted patients to the Real-Time Admitted Patients Dashboard from Wave 1. 

 
Additional details of the Design proposal can be found here: [SWIFT-7458 Design|https://confluence-prd.rochesterregional.org/spaces/SDTES/pages/243499050/SWIFT-7458+-+Create+a+C.+auris+dashboard+to+monitor+current+patients+across+the+system+with+a+c.+auris+diagnosis]
 
At this time, the Design is complete and just needs signing off from Operations. If we can get that, we can add SWIFT-7458, which represents Wave 1 described above, to the November release (likely with a few adjustments to what is already there). 
 
Please review and let us know if this is an acceptable path forward, as this came from an Incident Command situation. In the meantime, we will work to get time set up with Operations to discuss with them as well.
 
Tracy, Evan, Venu, please let me and the group know if I've missed or misrepresented anything! 
 
Thanks!
Molly
 
*Design meeting scheduled for 10/28 at 3:30 pm.* "

 # Research if and how we can incorporate the *Patient Problem* list into the framework - quick action bottoms ideally for efficiency
 # Owning Team: Referrals
 # 7/31 Completed + Review & Demo
 *  Per-recommendations from @epic the patient problem list should not be incorporated into the Follow Order framework primarily because the data isn't being evaluated within the DT.


 # Order Question Defaults -requested to streamline efficiency for the provider workflow
 # Operational lead will need to provide the \{Build Team} will need specific {*}Default requirements{*}- \{POC: Next Avail, Me or Team, Office Visit In-Person}
 # Owning Team: _Referrals_
 # 7/31 Completed + Review & Demo
 * Within Session 2 Demo, it was approved to Default Order Question ""Schedule Next Appt. With"" _Me or My Team_

 
 # Research if *Order Status and Order Expected Date* can be hidden \{@Epic Hard-Code} seen as duplicative, and conflicts with Order question ""Appt. Expected Date""
 # Owning Team: _Referrals_
 # 7/31 Completed + Review & Demo
 * Order Expected Date and Status fall under Epics hardcore and cannot be removed from the ORD context.
 *  Per recommendations from @epic, the build team removed our Custom Appointment Expected Date Order Question to reduce duplicative work and reduce Ordering user Clicks.

 
 # Dr. Sss shared a private version from his Follow up navigator to include Follow up-Reason for next appointment \{Quick action buttons}
 # This is configurable that can be built within the Order Question/Category list -However, the Clinical Operational team will need to provide a comprehensive list phase 1.
 # Owning Team: _Referrals_

Thanks, Dr. Ryan! The apps teams discussed this morning and decided on the following approach:

SWIFT-4852 will be moved out of the October release. 
 * For the November release, this will go back to Design. 
 * Michelle L. indicated that when she met with the team to review the build that was completed, there were some changes requested. With this Design phase, all of that can be ironed out. Additionally, it will provide time for Operations to complete the procedure documentation, competencies, and education.

 * Throughout November, we will continue evaluating progress and determine if the build can also be moved to PRD during that release. If not, the DEV would likely occur during the December release."

Hi [~g303497] 
https://jira.rochesterregional.org/browse/SWIFT-7072 DESIGN for 5011223 Urgent Care Transfers

The Design epic is currently in a status of ""To Do"", but 3 of the 4 stories are in a status of ""In Progress"".  Is there anything blocking the progression of this design or does the status of the epic just need updating."

By: Ciara Smith (C350735)Sent: a year ago
Met with the requestors and Tiffany Smith around this request. Currently, All ambulatory practices and urgent cares are tracking transfers from their outpatient sites to the ED with Safe Connect. Safe Connect is not a reliable way to record this information and they have been asked to find an alternative. Currently there are three identified ways a patient gets sent to the ED from the ambulatory space
1.    From urgent care, they are told to go to the ED (private vs ambulance)
2.    From outpatient setting they are told to go to the ED (private vs ambulance)
3.    Triage nurse on the phone tells patient to go to the ED

To measure these events for regulatory requirements- the group discussed with Krista and I the ability to have a smart phrase with data elements to capture these transfers in care connect. The group previously have drafted what they would like this smart phrase to look like.

.EmergencyTX
This individual suffers from an emergency medical condition that requires care beyond our services provided. After clinical assessment by \{PROVIDER/CLINICIAN NAME} it has been determined this patient requires emergency medical care or/transfer to higher level of care.

*Discussion Summary:*
 * Reviewed the initial design plan for a SmartPhrase incorporating embedded SDE records.
 * Identified a major concern: the current design would require reporting tools to search across all patient records in the system, which could significantly impact system memory and performance.
 * A new order-based approach was proposed as a potential alternative.
 * AMB will explore possible solutions in collaboration with BI partners to ensure reporting efficiency and system stability.

*Next Steps:*
 * AMB to investigate technical feasibility of the proposed order-based solution.
 * BI team to assess reporting implications and provide input on system impact."

Due to that, the build needs to be updated and is being reviewed by ASP and pharmacy to ensure there are no other updates that need to be taken into account.

Questions:

 # How does the Lab verify that these results correspond to the correct patient?
 # How do they determine which ORDER CSN to assign to the result?
 # Within the ED Narrator or ED Track Board, what options do we have to populate this information correctly?
 # From our discussion, I understand that when a laboratory result corresponds to a procedure included in the redraw procedure list provided by LIS, we should populate *OBR-25* with {*}‘I’ (In-Process){*}.

It would be great if you could add more information so we can include it in our design.

 
Key Questions & Answers:
 
1.      What is the workflow for LAB RedDraw? Who is responsible for performing it?
 
   • The original test (that was ordered in Epic by the provider) was canceled in LIS because it cannot be performed. The cancellation reason is documented on the LIS order #.
 
   •  Replacement order(s) are created on a new LIS order # (The 8-character number that starts with a letter, as you saw during the meeting). These replacement orders will generate an SN message being sent to Epic.  When this occurs, there is no existing order in Epic for this new order to attach to.
 
 
2.      In our call yesterday, it was mentioned that the Laboratory results sometimes come without an order number from CareConnect. Does this mean the specimen or sample collection was done without an order? Why does this happen?
 
   • The original test is canceled in LIS (with documented reason), and replacement orders generate new LIS order numbers without existing matching orders in EPIC.
 
 
3.      If this action is permitted, how does the Laboratory obtain patient information and print labels without a link to patient data in CareConnect for the patient encounter or CSN?
 
   • All of the patient information exists in these newly created orders in LIS (which are attached to the same CSN, which LIS refers to as a Billing #).
 
 
4.      How does the Laboratory handle specimens outside the ED setting?
 
   • All inpatient redraws are handled the same way.
 
 
5.      What are the workflows to ensure patient information is available without an order from CareConnect? How does the Lab verify that these results correspond to the correct patient?
 
   • Patient and order info are stored in LIS orders linked by CSN.
 
 
6.      How do they determine which ORDER CSN to assign to the result?
 
   • Patient and order info are stored in LIS orders linked by CSN.
 
 
7.      Within the ED Narrator or ED Track Board, what options do we have to populate this information correctly?
 
   • The nursing narrator filters orders based on ORD-90; we have the option to set which statuses are included, but it does not allow for no value, so orders without ORD-90 are never displayed to the nurses, which is impacting the redraw requests. ORD-115 does not impact the narrator as far as we know and was not part of the request
 
 
8.      From our call, I understand that if a laboratory result corresponds to a procedure listed in the redraw procedure list you will provide, we need to populate OBR-25 with ‘I’ (in-process). This, in turn, populates ORD-90 or ORD-115. Could you please clarify how this status is displayed to care providers in the ED? Specifically, is it visible via the ED Narrator or the ED Track Board?
 
   • We don’t want to handle redraw requests separately or in a special manner; we just want them to show up where any other new collection/order would be displayed. The reason for the focus on redraws is that these are currently broken.

My TS connected with Robert Erhardt (OTx TS) regarding the order status question I raised. Here’s the reply:

“Hey Ryan, I spent some time talking with Robert about this one - it sounds like order status is probably not the way to go. One option that would be consistent with how the ED does collection today would be to send the new orders through order transmittal and generate a collection task for the nurses that way. The incoming interface doesn't do this by default, but we can turn it on via TRIGGER_OTX and TRIGGER_OTX_OPTIONS=3-New Orders.

The issue with turning on OTx is that it's going to start running it for all orders created by the interface. I'm seeing a lot of traffic for POCT glucose and micro tests that are following the same SN/NA pattern, and we might not want to send those orders through OTx. Can we clarify with Soft all of the scenarios where they are placing new orders in Soft? We're probably going to need to do some testing and tweaking to get this right. The interface has very little flexibility - it either calls OTx or it doesn't. Anything beyond that, and we need the OTx rules to handle things.”"

This morning, I sent an email including my TS and Chad C. regarding potential workarounds in Soft and Epic. My original email asked:
 * *Soft:* Is there a way to add a flag if the result message is a redraw? This would allow us to specifically identify redraw messages.

 * *Epic:* One potential, though not ideal, solution is turning on {{TRIGGER_OTX}} with {{{}TRIGGER_OTX_OPTIONS=3-New Orders{}}}. The challenge here is that it would run for all orders created by the interface.

 * Could OTx generate a flag on messages triggered by a Soft redraw so we could filter these in Rhapsody and prevent them from being sent downstream?

Chad responded with the following:
 * Without any lab process/workflow changes the Rhap logic would have to be multi layered in order to tease out just the Soft Initiated orders that are specific to ‘Lab Redraws’

 ** 99% of the Orders that originate in Soft ({_}unsolicited orders sent from Soft{_} _à_ \{_}CC{_}) are not Lab Redraw Orders
 ** {_}What the Rhap logic might look like{_}{_}:{_}  Patient Class is ED + patient has a canceled lab test on that visit + lab placed a “prob code” order on visit + lab placed a new order for the test that was cancelled = if all true send a redraw flag to the track board
There is nothing unique about a Lab Redraw order in the HL7 message.  

*Next Steps:*

 ** We are going to check with the labs to see if they would be willing to alter their workflow
 ** {_}The Idea{_}:  all labs add a “redraw” comment or order to any test that needs to be re-order an ED and Rhap would fire on that??
 * The unfortunate part is that this would be a lab workflow driven solution ({_}human error could contribute to tests not flagging{_})

I have updated the Sherlock ticket I opened this morning. Our TS has not yet responded. Given these challenges, the *Oct 27 design deadline is not achievable* for this project. We are still exploring alternative workarounds to meet our objectives."

*Topic:* Creation and Implementation of a Multidisciplinary Note Type in Epic

 

*Discussion Summary*
 * *New Note Type Request*
 * The team discussed the development of a *multidisciplinary note type* within Epic.
 * The goal is to make this note type accessible to all users via a *single drop-down menu* for selecting note types in the ambulatory setting.


 * *Functionality Requirements*
 * Current system does *not support* selecting multiple note types from one location.
 * To meet this need, *new functionality must be enabled* in Epic.
 * Enabling this feature will {*}disable existing Notewriter templates{*}, which will need to be {*}converted to speed buttons{*}.
 * This change will have a {*}system-wide impact{*}.


 * *Communication & Considerations*
 * An email outlining the implications of enabling the new functionality was sent to *Dr. Cabral and Krista* for review.
 * *Andrew Krawic* raised concerns about downstream effects:
 * Close encounter validations
 * Letters
 * SmartPhrases
 * Any workflows that pull in notes may not recognize the new note type initially.


 * *Implementation Approach*
 * Dr. Cabral requested a minimal viable produce approach:
 * Initially implement just the {*}note type in the drop-down menu{*}.
 * Additional functionality and integration will be built out in future phases."

*Topic:* DXR Storage Strategy

*Discussion Summary:*
 * The team met to address concerns regarding long-term DXR data storage.
 * Consensus was reached to *archive* older DXR data rather than delete it.
 ** This approach allows for querying and temporary restoration of archived data when needed.

*Action Items:*
 # *Legal Review:*

 ** _Owner:_ Diana Adam-Podgornik
 ** _Task:_ Confirm lookback requirements—10 years (RRH) vs. 7 years (NYS)—with the legal team.
 # *Infrastructure Approval:*

 ** _Owner:_ Erik Jacobs
 ** _Task:_ Initiate conversations to obtain approval for server work, additional hardware, and associated costs resulting from the archiving decision.
 # *CER Rule Configuration:*

 ** _Task:_ Use CER rules to apply different lookback periods based on patient class, depending on legal guidance."
